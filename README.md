## Notes
have function to validate input? no numbers - punctuation is ok
haiku has 3 lines
line 1 has 5 syllables
line 2 has 7 syllables
line 3 has 5 syllables
function to parse input into lines 1/2/3 (output = 3 strings)
syllable counter that gets run on each line - returns number of syllables
overall return statement is json object with key pair values/properties - one could be rule, one is bool if it passes that rule

```json object
{
  line1has5syllables = true;
  line2has7syllables = true;
  line3has5syllables = true;
}```

syllable counter input = a line of text (string) "man dog is best friend"
run regex counter tracking # of occurances
syllable counter output = int (5)
